# Fun With Waves

I built Fun with Waves to explore the Playdate synth functionality. It lets you create an arbitrary number of overlapping sine waves and both see and hear the results. 

Press A to add a wave. Press B to delete the selected wave. Press up and down to toggle through the waves. And use the crank to change the frequency of the selected wave. 

Have fun making horrible noises!
